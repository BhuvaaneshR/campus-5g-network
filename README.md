#How to Access the Script(s):
First Start srsRAN Setup - connect two srsUE with two srsgNB with the open5GS.

Now install these .sh files and execute the following command to ensure the file is in an executable format (for all three files):
chmod +x "name_of_script".sh

Now execute the scripts using the following command:
./"name_of_script".sh

NOTE:Replace the "name_of_script".sh with the actual file name.
